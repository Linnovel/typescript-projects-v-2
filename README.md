These are all my frontend projects, which I used to practice and master Reactjs. I used tools like Zustand for content management, React Hook Form, and Zod for validation.
I use Reactjs tools like, custom hooks, useReducer, useState, useMemo, ContextApi, and many more. This was a fun experience, and in these months I gained a lot of experience, not just coding but designing user interfaces and working hard to be a better programmer. I will continue practicing and practicing.
